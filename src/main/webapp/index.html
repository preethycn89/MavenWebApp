	<p>Continuous Integration is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository at regular intervals. This concept was meant to remove the problem of finding later occurrence of issues in the build lifecycle. Continuous integration requires the developers to have frequent builds. The common practice is that whenever a code commit occurs, a build should be triggered.</p>

    <Div Align = "left">
	<p>Jenkins is a popular open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. Along with Jenkins, sometimes, one might also see the association of Hudson. Hudson is a very popular open-source Java-based continuous integration tool developed by Sun Microsystems which was later acquired by Oracle. After the acquisition of Sun by Oracle, a fork was created from the Hudson source code, which brought about the introduction of Jenkins.</p>
	<p>
	Jenkins will be installed on a server where the central build will take place. The basic functionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of steps, e.g. to compile Java source code and build a JAR from the resulting classes. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.</p>
	<p>
	Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example:<br><br>
	Perform a software build using a build system like Apache Maven or Gradle<br>
	Execute a shell script<br>
	Archive a build result<br>
	Run software tests<br><br>
	Jenkins monitors the execution of the steps and allows to stop the process, if one of the steps fails. Jenkins can also send out notifications in case of a build success or failure.<br>
	Jenkins can be extended by additional plug-ins. For example, you can install plug-ins to support building and testing Android applications.<br>
